Welcome to StudyGuide's manual!
StudyGuide is a planning and verifying tool for all the requirements of your studies
(for European-style university school systems).

How StudyGuide works and what it can do:

1. The student loads a study plan with courses, that he then enrolls in and distributes among semesters
2. They can then edit the plan: (un)fulfill courses, move enrollments around between semesters, add new courses, ...
3. StudyGuide always keeps them up-to-date on various broken constraints that are placed upon your study plan
4. The student can always clearly see what's left for them to do until they can graduate -- or they can play
around with the plan and create various "what-if" scenarios and explore their choices.

Read the following sections if you want to learn to work with StudyGuide quickly and effectively.

== Getting help

If you can't find the answer to your question or request in this document
(located in the menu, in "%root.help" -> "%root.help"),
feel free to submit a pull request / issue in the GitHub repository of StudyGuide,
post a question on StackOverflow,
or email me personally. You can find all the needed information in the menu, in
"%root.help" -> "%root.about".

=== Changing the language

If you want to run a translated version of StudyGuide, set your system locale accordingly and restart StudyGuide.

If you want to try out a translated version (on Linux) without changing your system locale permanently,
try running: `LC_ALL="LOCALE" java -jar StudyGuide.jar`, where `LOCALE` is any locale available on your system
(run `locale -a` to view all available).

StudyGuide currently does not support changing the language on the fly.

== Load and save a study plan

If you want to start from scratch, click on "%root.file" -> "%root.new" in the menu bar.
This will create an empty study plan for you, with no courses and no semesters.
To learn how to fill your study plan in, read through the section <<Edit your study plan>>.

=== Loading a plan

In the upper left corner, in the menu bar, click on "%root.file" -> "%root.open".
A dialog window will open, letting you choose the file to open.
StudyGuide study plans usually have a `.json` extension.

After a short while, your study plan should open up in the application. If something goes wrong,
an error dialog will display and notify you of what went wrong.

=== Saving a plan

After you are finished (or just want to save your progress), you need to save your plan, StudyGuide does *not* do
this automatically for you. Just click on "%root.file" -> "%root.save" to save the plan into the file you
read it from, or "%root.saveAs" to save it to a new file.

=== Demo plans

For your convenience, there are various pre-built study plans for you to try out.
Most of them are from the Computer Science section of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University.
You can find all of them in the folder `src/test/resources/com/oskopek/studyguide/persistence/`,
located in the project directory.

=== Download a study plan from a HTML document

StudyGuide supports downloading and importing study plans from any HTML file of a valid format (even local files).
Currently, the only valid format supported is the one the Computer Science section of link:http://www.mff.cuni.cz/[MFF]
uses on link:http://www.mff.cuni.cz/studium/bcmgr/ok/itoc.htm[its pages],
for example this one: link:http://www.mff.cuni.cz/studium/bcmgr/ok/ib3a21.htm[].
No other formats are supported at this time.

To try it out, click on "%root.file" -> "%root.openFrom" and paste a URL of a validly formatted study plan HTML file.
The plan will import itself and you can then add semesters and enroll in courses as shown in section <<Edit your study plan>>.

== Edit your study plan

Using StudyGuide, you can do quite a lot of changes to your plan.
Here is an overview of the currently available actions.

=== Adding/removing semesters

Click on the "%semesterPane.addSemester" button to append a new empty semester to the plan.
To remove a semester and all it's associated course enrollments, click on the " - " button in the upper right
corner of the given semester.

You can also change the name of a semester -- just write a new one in the name field in
the upper left corner of the semester.
Do note that the name has to be unique with respect to all the other semester names in a plan.

=== Creating new courses

To create a new course to the plan, click on "%semesterPane.newCourse" in the upper left of the application.
In the right side panel called "%studyPane.courseDetails" your new course will show, and you can edit its
properties. It will now be available to enroll in.

By "creating a course" we mean adding it to the list of courses that can be enrolled in, not directly enrolling
and placing it into a semester. To enroll an already created course, see the section <<Enrolling in a course>>.

=== Add a course from SIS

To be able to add a course from an online resource
(link:https://www.cuni.cz/UK-4428.html[SIS -- Student Information System])
you must first configure a valid SIS URL base (f.e. VSCHT `https://student.vscht.cz/` or CUNI `https://is.cuni.cz/studium/`),
using the dialog in "%root.SIS" -> "%root.setSisUrl".

Once you have a SIS URL configured, click on the "%semesterPane.addCourseFrom" button in the upper left corner
and enter a course ID. The course will be imported into your study plan and you can now find it using
"%studyPane.addCourse" on the upper right.

=== Enrolling in a course

Once you have at least one semester and a course in your plan, you can enroll into it.
To do so, find a course (using it's ID or name) in the "%studyPane.addCourse" panel on the right and
choose from the list of courses presented to you.
The chosen course will be enrolled in into the last semester in the plan.

After it has been added, you can drag and drop the enrollment around, moving it from semester to semester.
To mark it as fulfilled (f.e. after the student passed the exam associated with it), click on the checkbox
to the right of the course enrollment name and a "%checkmark" will appear.
If you want to remove the enrollment altogether, click on the "%crossmark" on the far right.

=== Semester statistics

At the top of each semester, between the semester name and remove button, semester statistics are displayed.
Currently, StudyGuide shows these:

* Fulfilled/Total -- the fulfilled credit sum / the total credit sum of courses enrolled in the given semester
* ECTS workload estimation -- a non-negative number determining the difficulty of the planned semester in terms of
course workload. The text color tries to warn users the semester will be too easy (green)
or too hard (red). Typical workload values are at around 30, denoted by the yellow color.

== Verifying constraints

Did you notice, that while marking courses as (un)fulfilled that the broken constraints in the lower-right corner changed?
Constraints that are configured in the plan are automatically verified and if they're broken,
the user is automatically notified.

Currently, constraints and course group cannot be added/modified using the graphical user interface
(you can do so only programmatically or by manually changing the input file).

For the various types of constraints, information on where they are displayed and what they mean, read through
the following sections.

=== Course enrollment constraints

These constraints are enrollment-specific -- they are therefore displayed inline, on the far left of the enrollment.
If they're broken, a small red "%warning" sign appears. If the  hover your mouse over the "%warning" icon,
a tooltip showing the reason the constraint was broken.

Currently available course enrollment constraints:

* CourseEnrollmentCorequisiteConstraint -- all courses listed as corequisites for this course enrollment
have to be enrolled in at the latest in the semester this enrollment is in
* CourseEnrollmentEnrolledInConstraint -- checks whether the course is enrolled in a semester the course is taught (summer, winter or both)
* CourseEnrollmentPrerequisiteConstraint -- all courses listed as prerequisites for this course
were fulfilled at the latest in the semester preceding this enrollment

=== Global constraints

Global constraints are instantiated only once in a study plan. If they're broken, they will display a warning
with a helpful message in the "%studyPane.brokenConstraints" panel in the lower right corner.

Currently available global constraints:

* GlobalCourseMaxFulfilledConstraint -- maximum number of times a course may be fulfilled
(i.e. a student cannot pass a course more than N times)
* GlobalCourseRepeatedEnrollmentConstraint -- maximum number of times a course may be enrolled in
(i.e. a student cannot enroll in a course more than N times)
* GlobalCreditsSumConstraint -- the minimum sum of credits from fulfilled courses a student needs in the whole plan
* GlobalCreditsSumUntilSemesterConstraint -- the minimum sum of credits from fulfilled courses a student needs until a given semester is over
* GlobalLongStudyFeeConstraint -- notifies the user of the fee sum he will pay with the currently set up plan (if he has a non-empty semester at index N or later)

=== Course group constraints

Course groups are special lists of courses over which we can verify constraints.
For example: the study plan may contain a list of compulsory courses, that all students have to pass.
We can then put a "CourseGroupFulfilledAllConstraint" over that group, to check if all of them have been
fulfilled sooner or later in the current plan.

If they're broken, they will display a warning with a helpful message in the "%studyPane.brokenConstraints" panel in the lower right corner,
along with the global constraints.

Currently available course group constraints:

* CourseGroupCreditsPercentageConstraint -- minimum percentage of credits from fulfilled courses from this group
a student needs
* CourseGroupCreditsSumConstraint -- minimum sum of credits from fulfilled courses from this group a student needs
* CourseGroupFulfilledAllConstraint -- the student needs to fulfill all of the courses in this group
